# Reinforcement-Learning-Model

This report presents our approach that combines machine learning techniques with blockchain technology to effectively identify vulnerable image containers and then secure them. We propose a machine learning model, based on the Q- learning algorithm. This algorithm is a reinforcement learning model, to analyze container images and flag those who have vulnerable characteristics. The Q-learning agent interacts with a container image repository environment and learns to make informed decisions based on specific parameters -payload size, sharing points, and the number of updates associated with each container image.
The solution we are proposing will be evaluated using a dataset containing information about the container images, and then a Q-learning agent will be trained over a specific number of episodes. Once the training is completed, this model can be used to evaluate different sets of image containers and it will be able to identify the image containers that are of high risk.
Once the model identifies the vulnerable container images, we propose to integrate them with blockchain technology to secure them from poisoning attacks. This will ensure the integrity, immutability, and traceability of the vulnerability information.

Pseudocode for identifying vulnerable containers using Q-Learning Algorithm
1. Initialize:
- Define the ImageContainerEnv environment
- Define the Q-LearningAgent with specified hyperparameters - Load and normalize the container data
2. Train the Q-LearningAgent:
For each episode from 1 to num_episodes:
- Reset the environment and get the initial state
- Initialize total_reward, step, and filled_slot to 0
- While not done and step < max_steps and filled_slot < max_high_risk_containers:
- Choose an action based on the current state and available slots
- Take the chosen action and observe the next state, reward, done flag, and selected flag - Store the transition (state, action, reward, next_state, done) in the replay buffer
- Update the Q-value using the Bellman equation and the replay buffer
- Update total_reward, state, step, and filled_slot
- Append the total_reward to episode_rewards - Print the episode number and total reward
11
3. Evaluate the trained Q-LearningAgent:
- Reset the environment and get the initial state - Initialize container_rewards to an empty list
- While not done:
- Choose an action based on the current state and available slots
- Take the chosen action and observe the next state, reward, done flag, and selected flag - Append the container name and reward to container_rewards
- Update the state
- Sort container_rewards in descending order based on the reward
4. Create the top high-risk containers list:
- Select the top max_high_risk_containers from the sorted container_rewards
- Create a new DataFrame, top_high_risk_data, with the selected high-risk containers - Calculate the total reward for the top max_high_risk_containers
5. Save the results:
- Save the top_high_risk_data DataFrame to a CSV file - Print the total reward for the top containers
